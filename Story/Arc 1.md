# Main Plot

### The Truth:

- The **Harvest Bell** is powered by a sealed crystal with a Demon of Avarice in its core.
    
- Over years, corruption has seeped out, infecting townsfolk.
    
- When [[Mayor Elric Danton]] toasts, the bell’s seal shatters, releasing smoke that corrupts everyone at once.
    
- The loop resets because the bell is also a temporal anchor — breaking means repeating the day.
    

---

### What Players Must Discover Across Loops:

1. **The Bell is the Source** (via [[Old Bram - Cryptic NPC]] + [[Mira Fenwick - Child]] hints).
    
2. **The [[Mayor Elric Danton]] is Unwittingly Weakened** (his tonic is corrupting him).
    
3. **The Caravan Spread Dust** ([[Captain Rowan Harth]] + [[Tomas Kettler]]'s ledger + first victim clues).
    
4. **The Ritual Runes are Warped** ([[Old Bram - Cryptic NPC]] scrawled notes, [[Clock Tower]] runes).
    

---

### Final Loop Solution Options:

- **Purify**: Use discovered ritual notes to repair the runes → stabilizes bell, prevents smoke.
    
- **Destroy**: Smash the bell before evening → no smoke, but the town loses its “protection.”
    
- **Sacrifice**: One PC (or the mayor) attunes themselves to the bell, containing the corruption but binding their soul (bittersweet ending).

## Between the loops
### Step-by-Step Flow of the Loop Ending

#### **1. The Mayor’s Speech (Tension Layering)**

- Keep his tone rehearsed and polite, even as the **clock chimes**.
    
- Each toll should _slightly distort_ him — a twitch, a repeating word, his voice echoing wrong.
    
- By the final chime, the speech dissolves into static phrases (“We gather again—again—again—”) right before the horror hits.  
    → This builds unease instead of surprise-kill energy.
    

#### **2. The Mutation Scene (From Familiar to Wrong)**

- Let the transformation be _instant and dreamlike_, not gory. Use imagery like:
    
    > “Skin folds outward like petals in reverse.”  
    > “Eyes bloom across their faces, but none of them see you.”
    
- Describe the soundscape: a clock hammering _inside their skulls_, bells behind their ribs.
    
- Important: Don’t give them a “combat encounter.” Let them _try_ to fight — but the blows land like hitting fog, or the crowd regenerates instantly.  
    This communicates: _This is inevitable, not a TPK._
    

#### **3. The Drowning Void**

- When they’re overrun, **fade into sensory descriptions**:
    
    - “You can’t tell if you’re falling or floating.”
        
    - “The bell sounds like it’s underwater.”
        
    - “Your own breath tastes like iron and memory.”
        
- No hit points, no checks — pure narrative control.
    
- Let everyone see a _fragment_:
    
    - a loved one repeating their last words,
        
    - the ratty NPC screaming from another timeline,
        
    - or the _other party’s footprints_ in sand that dissolves into stars.  
        Each player gets a glimpse of a personal truth or echo.
        

#### **4. The Pull & Awakening**

- The pull should feel like **being rewound**, not resurrected:
    
    > “Your limbs jerk backward; the air folds like paper; the world inhales.”
    
- They stumble through the city gates again. The sound of the _bell_ follows them — faint, wrong, maybe even reversed.
    
- The **gate slams shut** — same as before — but dust falls upward, not down.
    

#### **5. The Glitching Repetition**

- NPCs act almost identical, but broken:
    
    - A baker laughs half a sentence and then starts it over.
        
    - A child’s balloon floats backward into their hand.
        
    - The mayor’s assistant is already waiting, like they _remember_ being late last time.
        
- Let them catch on through dialogue:
    
    > “Didn’t we already meet?”  
    > “The sun feels tired today, doesn’t it?”
    
- Subtle. Don’t tell them it’s a loop — they’ll know.
    

### Tone Calibration

If you want them **awed, not angry**, emphasize:

- _Inevitability_ over _helplessness_.
    
- _Discovery_ over _defeat_.
    
- _Emotion_ over _mechanics._
    

And right after they wake, let one NPC or player find a **tiny anomaly** that proves this isn’t just a bad dream:

- A **wound scar** they didn’t have.
    
- A **broken pocketwatch** ticking backward.
    
- A **half-remembered phrase** from the void.
    

That makes the players feel _curious_, not punished — they _earned_ the next mystery.

## Conclusion
### **Step 1: The Moment of Break**

- “The bell tolls once more — but this time, the sound doesn’t echo. It _shatters._ The air vibrates like glass cracking, and all around you the world trembles, like a painting smudging under water.”
    
- “NPCs freeze mid-gesture. A smile hangs half-formed, a laugh cut short. The festival stalls shimmer, colors dripping away.”
    

---

### **Step 2: The Release**

- “Time _rushes_ forward in a single breath — clouds streak across the sky, banners whip and tear, food rots and renews in the blink of an eye. Then it all exhales into stillness.”
    
- “The pressure you’ve carried this whole loop lifts like a great weight from your chest. For the first time since arriving here… silence.”
    

---

### **Step 3: The Aftermath**

- “The townsfolk slowly resume moving, but their eyes are wet — as if they’ve just awoken from a long, painful dream they can’t remember.”
    
- “You notice small fractures in the air itself, spiderwebs of faint light, closing one by one. Some don’t close.”
