### S + L's Journal

^sylasJournal

**Location: [[Clock Tower]]: 1st Floor**
When the players touch the half-burnt journal, the world stills. Dust freezes mid-air, color drains, and a **faint blue shimmer** ripples through the room like disturbed water.  
Two silhouettes flicker into view — **a man kneeling**, **a woman reaching toward him**. Their voices overlap the silence, echoing from somewhere _outside_ of time.

> **Sylas (distant, strained):** “The loops… the echoes will bleed through.”  
> **Lily (soft, almost breaking):** “Then maybe… let them.”
> - S.T. & L.C of the Echobound

The shimmer collapses inward.  
Silence.  
The journal turns to ash between their fingers.
