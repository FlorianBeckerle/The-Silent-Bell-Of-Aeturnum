## The Echobound  
*(Notes: beings tied to Kaelyth and the Loom — mix of TVA, ghosts, and divine phantoms. Work as temporal custodians across fractured realities.)*

### Nature  
Echobound are beings that once **were** — echoes of individuals erased through paradox, time fracture, or loop collapse. They no longer exist in the proper flow of reality but continue on as **phantoms woven back together by Kaelyth**, the Riftkeeper.  
They are fragments of consciousness and memory, given form to maintain the balance of existence itself.

*(Note: think Outer Wilds x Loki TVA, but with melancholy rather than bureaucracy.)*

### Purpose  
Their existence is entirely utilitarian: **to preserve the fabric of the Loom**.  
They are deployed wherever time distorts — in Rift-Towns, collapsing cycles, or dying realities — ensuring causality doesn’t unravel.  
To mortals, they appear as **ghosts of possible futures or forgotten selves**.  

> “We are what remains when time corrects itself.”

*(GM note: they can show up when players cause paradoxes or break loop rules. Serve as both warning and mystery.)*

### Origin  
When the first loop was broken, the “saved” timeline was imperfect. Those who perished or existed differently across cycles didn’t return cleanly.  
**Kaelyth gathered their remnants** — memories without bodies, bodies without moments — and bound them into new forms: the Echobound.  
They exist *between* threads, answering directly to the deities of order and preservation.

*(Note: maybe include one Echobound as a cryptic NPC that recognizes the PCs from other loops.)*

### Role in the World  
They act as **temporal custodians**.  
Neither benevolent nor cruel — they simply do what must be done to preserve the Loom.  
Some correct fractures by stabilizing them; others erase the unstable elements (including heroes who have seen too much).  

*(Narrative hook: the PCs might one day *become* Echobound if they die during a loop.)*

### Appearance  
Faint silhouettes stitched together from shifting light and shadow.  
Their form flickers between different versions of who they were — age, gender, species constantly in flux.  
When they speak, multiple voices overlap: past, present, and future whispering as one.  

> “You shouldn’t be here… yet.”

*(Note: visual cue — mild distortion, like afterimages or echoes following movement.)*

### Personality Traits  
- Detached yet oddly compassionate — they remember love, but can no longer feel it.  
- Haunted by glimpses of lives they never lived.  
- Utterly loyal to Kaelyth — it’s woven into their existence.  
- Fear the moment the Loom stops calling their name — true oblivion. [[Saedrin, the Devourer of Light]]

*(Tone: tragic and stoic; they aren’t villains, just consequences.)*

### Gameplay Hooks  
- Appear when PCs cause paradoxes or manipulate time directly.  
- Offer cryptic guidance:  
  *“Your choice unthreads more than you see.”*  
- Might test the heroes to determine if their actions align with Kaelyth’s design.  
- An Echobound who regains fragments of their former self could rebel, becoming an ally or enemy with knowledge of *all* loops.  **Possible Main Villain**

*(GM Note: Treat them like cosmic echoes — morally neutral, mysterious, unkillable except through narrative closure.)*
