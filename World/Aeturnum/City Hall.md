#location
**Location**: Broad stone building facing the square, with weathered banners.  
- **Vibe**: Smells of ink and old wood. Bell tower rings at fixed hours (tolls ominously before the catastrophe).  
- **NPC Anchor**: [[Mayor Elric Danton]] — fussing over paperwork, trying to ignore signs of doom.  
- **Loop Potential**: Speeches and commands shift depending on what the PCs reveal.
