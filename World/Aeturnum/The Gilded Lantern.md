- **Location**: Just off the main square, windows glowing warm at night.  
- **Vibe**: Sawdust floors, big hearth, locals murmuring about the festival.  
- **NPC Anchor**: [[Tomas Kettler]] — genial, gossipy innkeeper who knows everyone’s business.  
- **Loop Potential**:  
  - Always places the same barrel outside.  
  - Can serve as a meeting hub or clue-spot in later loops.
