# Stats
## Health

**Resets at the start of each loop.**  
When time rewinds, their bodies are restored. This keeps combat stakes high but not frustrating.

_Optional variant:_ Characters who died last loop start the next with a faint “echo scar” — a pale mark, tremor, or recurring whisper that reminds them something is wrong.

## Stress

**Partially carries over.**  
Stress represents the mind cracking under repetition and horror.

Each loop, reduce total stress to **half (rounded down)** — they regain composure but never full peace.  
You can call this lingering portion **“Echo Stress.”**

Roleplay effects: nightmares, déjà vu, unease, paranoia.

## Abilities, Skills & Powers

**Carry over completely.**  
They remember what they’ve learned; even if time resets, their souls remember the loop.

Mechanically: any unlocked ability, feat, or custom boon remains.  
Narratively: they know what’s coming — so they can plan or exploit events differently.

### Abilities with Limited Uses

**Reset each loop.**  
A new loop counts as a new “session” or “long rest.”  
The world rewinds, and so does any power that’s fueled by rest or time passing.

---

## Armor, Gear & Items

**Physical gear resets unless it’s “Loop-touched.”**  
Normal weapons, gold, or tools rewind with the loop.  
Artifacts or mementos tied to the loop’s magic can persist — these become narrative anchors (a cracked watch, a burned note, a pendant that hums).

Let each player keep **one persistent item** after the second loop. It can evolve, gain runes, or reveal secrets over time.

## Consumables (Potions, Scrolls, Charms, etc.)

**Reset each loop** — unless they’ve become _Loop-touched._  
Anything used or spent is restored when time rewinds, since the loop restores the world’s physical state.

**Variant:** (discuss with players once loop mechanic is revealed)
Purchased potions, etc. remain in inventory to prevent the players from having to go to the store to buy stuff every turn.
Alternatively players get the same items again and again and we just skip the roleplay. *Does NOT INCLUDE Quest-Items*

## Hope & Fear

These form the emotional economy of the loop — the tension between renewal and collapse.

**Hope resets** each loop. Every new dawn feels like a fresh start, even if they subconsciously remember past failures.

**Fear accumulates slowly** across loops as reality frays.  
If Fear ever outweighs Hope, the loop begins to destabilize — time shortens, days blur, and strange phenomena occur.
