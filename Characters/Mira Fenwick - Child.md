- **Ancestry**: Halfling (Smallfolk)  
- **Appearance**: 9 years old, dark curly hair tied with mismatched ribbons, patched dress always dusty from play. Wears a bracelet of colored twine she swears is “magic.”  
- **Demeanor**: Curious, fearless, often says unsettlingly wise things for her age. Laughs easily, trusts the party quickly.  
- **Loop Flavor**: Always starts a game of tag near the fountain. Sometimes hums a lullaby that only makes sense after players hear it more than once.
