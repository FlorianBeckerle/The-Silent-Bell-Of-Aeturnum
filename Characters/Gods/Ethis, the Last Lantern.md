#god 
**Domain:** Hope, endurance, and the fragile persistence of the soul.  
**Symbols:** A lantern burning underwater; hands cupped around a spark.  
**Whispers:** “If you can still see, then it is not over.”  
→ Few follow Ethis openly, but every traveler who lights a candle in the dark honors them.

**Personality:**

- The gentlest of the pantheon, but the most terrifying when cornered — hope weaponized.
    
- Smiles often, but it’s a brittle kind of optimism. They _know_ the end is coming but refuse to stop shining.
    
- Treats mortals with compassion, not because they are important, but because they _still try._
    
- Deeply resents Saedrin, and pities Kaelyth — believes both have forgotten what light means.
    

**Mannerisms:**

- A faint glow flickers from beneath their robes, pulsing with their heartbeat.
    
- Sometimes lights invisible candles around them — each one representing a life they’ve seen rekindled.
    
- Cries molten tears that cool into glass beads.
    

**Speech example:**

> “Even in a world that burns, one hand can still shield a spark. Will you?”
