**Domain:** Entropy, oblivion, cosmic decay.  
**Symbols:** A sun half-consumed by shadow, teeth carved in stone.  
**Whispers:** “Even the stars are meals for time.”  
→ Ancient cults worship Saedrin as the end of every cycle — the force that demands balance.


**Personality:**

- Not evil — simply the one who understands that _everything must end._
    
- Speaks softly, with warmth, as if comforting you before swallowing you whole.
    
- Finds beauty in collapse and reverence in decay.
    
- Sees Kaelyth as a fool for delaying the inevitable.
    

**Mannerisms:**

- Moves like smoke rising and falling in slow motion.
    
- When near, shadows grow longer, yet the air feels strangely calm.
    
- Often addresses people by their _final_ titles: “You who will die as hero,” “You who will be forgotten.”
    

**Speech example:**

> “Do not fear me. You are already fading. I merely make it graceful.”
