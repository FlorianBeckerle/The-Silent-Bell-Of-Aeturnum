#god 
**Domain:** Time loops, liminal spaces, and the weight of repetition.  
**Symbols:** A cracked hourglass bleeding starlight.  
**Whispers:** “I do not walk through the abyss. I make the path repeat.”  
→ Believed to wander the boundaries between cycles, binding what should have died and what cannot begin.

**Personality:**

- Calm to the point of eeriness; speaks in loops, repeating phrases slightly altered.
    
- Appears patient, but underneath is exhaustion — a being who’s held the threads too long.
    
- Sees mortals as _variables_, not souls; yet there’s melancholy in how they speak your name, as if memorizing it will make it last.
    
- When angered, time itself stutters — sound echoes twice, candles flicker backward.
    

**Mannerisms:**

- Often “rewinds” their own gestures, moving backward before continuing forward.
    
- Sometimes finishes your sentence before you say it.
    
- Treats the loop as sacred, and will defend it even from those trying to end it.
    

**Speech example:**

> “I have met you before. I will meet you again. We are the same conversation, spoken at different hours.”
