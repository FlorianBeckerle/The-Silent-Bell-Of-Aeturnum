**Domain:** Sound, silence, and truth hidden in echoes.  
**Symbols:** A silver bell with no clapper; concentric ripples in black water.  
**Whispers:** “All sound returns to silence, save the guilty.”  
→ Often depicted as blind, listening for the resonance of lies and forgotten prayers.

**Personality:**

- Speaks in whispers, never louder than a breath, yet always heard clearly.
    
- Obsessed with honesty — not morality, but resonance. Lies _detune_ reality in their presence.
    
- Neutral yet cruelly precise. They take no sides, only the frequency that “rings true.”
    
- Finds beauty in confession and horror in denial.
    

**Mannerisms:**

- Tilts their head as if listening to something no one else can hear.
    
- Pauses for long moments, letting silence fill the air until it becomes unbearable.
    
- Sometimes echoes your own voice back at you, saying what you _should have said._
    

**Speech example:**

> “You tremble when you lie. Do you know how loud that sounds to me?”
