#pantheon #god 

The Pantheon, once a glorious realm of the 5 Gods, now broken, corrupted and infested with plagues of the realms between.

# Gods
## [[Ethis, the Last Lantern]] fights to keep reality form unweaving
## [[Kaelyth, the Riftkeeper]] desperately tries to hold it together 
## [[Nheras, the Hollow Bell]] ensures truth doesn't distort it
## [[Rehr - the Veilborne]] something
## [[Saedrin, the Devourer of Light]] waits to consume what must end
