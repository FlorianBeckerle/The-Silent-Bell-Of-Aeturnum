- **Ancestry**: Elf (Fey-touched)  
- **Appearance**: Ragged cloak of patchwork feathers, wiry frame, sharp nose, eyes milky but glimmering faintly. He smells of damp earth and ash.  
- **Demeanor**: Muttering, erratic, voice jumps from whisper to sudden laughter. Always seems to know *too much*, but answers sideways.  
- **Loop Flavor**: First loop he seems like a harmless beggar. Second loop, he greets the PCs with “Oh… you again.” Later, his riddles point directly toward the nature of the loop — but never in plain words.  

# Timetable

**Dawn**: Lurks by gate, watching new arrivals.  
**Speech**: Stands in shadows, muttering during the speech.  
**Noon**: Wanders alleys, scribbling strange notes.  
**Afternoon**: Found near bell tower, staring at runes.  
**Evening**: Laughs bitterly as chaos erupts: _“And so it tolls again.”_

# **Mystery**:

- Knows of the loops (semi-aware outsider).
    
- His notes contain fragments of past failed days.
    
- Cryptically guides the party: “Break the bell or mend it.”
