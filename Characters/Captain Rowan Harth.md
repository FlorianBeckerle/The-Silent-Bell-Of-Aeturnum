- **Ancestry**: Dwarven (Stone-blooded)  
- **Appearance**: Stocky and broad-shouldered, with auburn beard bound in metal rings. Armor polished but dented from old campaigns.  
- **Demeanor**: Stern, disciplined, speaks like every word is an order. Rarely smiles, but softens when speaking to children.  
- **Loop Flavor**: Patrols the square at the same times daily. In later loops, his helmet shows cracks or he hesitates before drawing his blade — hints of déjà vu he won’t admit.  
# Timetable
**Dawn**: At his post, joking with fellow guards.  
**Speech**: Helps crowd control during mayor’s address.  
**Noon**: Patrols streets; dismisses player concerns.  
**Afternoon**: At barracks; polishing armor, drinking.  
**Evening**: Watches festival perimeter; is among the first to fall to corruption.

# **Mystery**:

- He’s noticed caravans sneaking in crystal dust but was bribed to ignore it.
    
- His guilt shows after probing: _“I thought it was just… powder. Didn’t think it’d kill folk.”_
    
- His testimony points to a smuggler (maybe Mira’s ledger confirms).
