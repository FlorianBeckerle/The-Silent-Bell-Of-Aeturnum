# Main Plot & How to Stop the Catastrophe

### The Truth:

- The **Harvest Bell** is powered by a sealed crystal with a Demon of Avarice in its core.
    
- Over years, corruption has seeped out, infecting townsfolk.
    
- When the mayor toasts, the bell’s seal shatters, releasing smoke that corrupts everyone at once.
    
- The loop resets because the bell is also a temporal anchor — breaking means repeating the day.

### What Players Must Discover Across Loops:

1. **The Bell is the Source** (via Ratty NPC + Mira’s hints).
    
2. **The Mayor is Unwittingly Weakened** (his tonic is corrupting him).
    
3. **The Caravan Spread Dust** (Guard + Tomas’s ledger + first victim clues).
    
4. **The Ritual Runes are Warped** (Ratty NPC scrawled notes, bell tower runes).

### Final Loop Solution Options:

- **Purify**: Use discovered ritual notes to repair the runes → stabilizes bell, prevents smoke.
    
- **Destroy**: Smash the bell before evening → no smoke, but the town loses its “protection.”
    
- **Sacrifice**: One PC (or the mayor) attunes themselves to the bell, containing the corruption but binding their soul (bittersweet ending).

### **Step 1: The Moment of Break**

- “The bell tolls once more — but this time, the sound doesn’t echo. It _shatters._ The air vibrates like glass cracking, and all around you the world trembles, like a painting smudging under water.”
    
- “NPCs freeze mid-gesture. A smile hangs half-formed, a laugh cut short. The festival stalls shimmer, colors dripping away.”

### **Step 2: The Release**

- “Time _rushes_ forward in a single breath — clouds streak across the sky, banners whip and tear, food rots and renews in the blink of an eye. Then it all exhales into stillness.”
    
- “The pressure you’ve carried this whole loop lifts like a great weight from your chest. For the first time since arriving here… silence.”

### **Step 3: The Aftermath**

- “The townsfolk slowly resume moving, but their eyes are wet — as if they’ve just awoken from a long, painful dream they can’t remember.”
    
- “You notice small fractures in the air itself, spiderwebs of faint light, closing one by one. Some don’t close.”
