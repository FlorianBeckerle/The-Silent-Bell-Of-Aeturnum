- **Ancestry**: Human (Stalwart)  
- **Appearance**: Thickset man in his late fifties, thinning gray hair, deep lines around his eyes from years of worry. His mayoral chain looks polished, but his coat sleeves are frayed.  
- **Demeanor**: Overburdened, authoritative voice that cracks under pressure. Pretends to be in control but hides a constant twitch of fear.  
- **Loop Flavor**: Delivers the same speech at City Hall steps each morning. By later loops, small cracks show: he stumbles on words, papers go missing, or he mutters that he’s “said this before.”  

# Mayor’s Festival Speech

^MayorsFestivalSpeech

> *“People of our fair town — neighbors, friends, kin — today we gather as we have every year, beneath the turning leaves and the watchful sky. The Harvest is a gift, and we give thanks for the soil that bore it, the hands that toiled, and the hearths that shall be filled.”*

> *“Tonight, lanterns will shine in every window, and music will rise from every street. We celebrate not only what we have gathered, but what we have endured together. The storms, the lean months, the shadows on the road — none of these broke us. We remain steadfast.”*

> *“So lift your cups, string your banners, and light the fire in the square. Let this festival be a promise: that tomorrow will dawn brighter than today, and that **no night is so long** the sun forgets to rise.”*

### Loop Variations
- **First loop**: Said confidently, warmly, with applause from townsfolk.  
- **Second loop**: He falters on *“no night is so long”* — as if he’s said it before. A paper slips from his hand, words forgotten.  
- **Final loop**: His voice cracks. He doesn’t finish the last line. Silence spreads before the bell tolls…  
# Timetable
**Dawn**: In City Hall, rehearsing speech nervously.  
**Speech**: Gives his Harvest Festival address.  
**Noon**: Meets briefly with guards; looks tired, drinks tonic.  
**Afternoon**: In his office, writing notes; muttering about “the bell” not working properly.  
**Evening**: Toasts at the festival → corrupted smoke erupts.

# **Mystery**:

- He knows the bell is faltering but hides it to avoid panic.
    
- His tonic is laced with powdered crystal (he’s slowly being corrupted). Hears demonic whispers
    
- The mayor’s bloodline has always “attuned” to the bell to keep it safe.
