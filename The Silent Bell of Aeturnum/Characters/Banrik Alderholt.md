**Role:** Shopkeeper of _Alderholt’s Goods_ (general store)  
**Appearance:** Middle-aged, balding man with ink-stained fingers from keeping ledgers, always smells faintly of tobacco and dry herbs.
## Gameplay Uses

- Players can **buy useful supplies** in early loops (torches, rope, healing kits, etc.).
    
- Discovering the **cellar secret** teaches them that corruption isn’t random — it’s spreading from tainted crystal goods.
    
- In the final loop, they might **convince Branik to help** (hand over caravan info, provide supplies, or even stand against the demon).
## Timetable

- **Dawn**: Shop is open. Cheerful, welcoming. Sells normal adventuring supplies.
    
    - Line: _“Best stock in town, fresh from the caravans! You’ll need it for the festival, eh?”_
        
- **Speech**: Closes shop, attends the mayor’s address. Proud supporter of tradition.
    
    - Line: _“The bell’s kept us safe all my life. Long may it ring.”_
        
- **Noon**: Shop shutters closed. Branik looks worried, ushering people away.
    
    - (If PCs peek inside: muffled noises from the cellar.)
        
- **Afternoon**: Shop locked tight. A **corrupted townsfolk** (former customer) is trapped in his cellar. Branik is panicked, praying no one finds out.
    
    - If confronted: _“Please… I just need time. He was a good man, a good man!”_
        
- **Evening**: At the festival with his family. Corrupted with the rest of the town.

## Mystery

- **Ledger Clue**: His shop ledger shows a caravan delivery marked with a strange symbol (same as the crystal dust shipments).
    
- **Cellar Clue**: The trapped customer is mid-way through transforming. Provides evidence that the corruption spreads before the final toll.
    
- **Personal Conflict**: Branik hides the truth to protect his family’s reputation, unintentionally letting the corruption worsen.
