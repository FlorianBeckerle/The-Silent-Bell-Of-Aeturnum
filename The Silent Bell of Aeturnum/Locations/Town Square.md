**Location**: Cobblestone plaza with a cracked fountain in the middle.  
- **Vibe**: Children playing tag, half-built stalls, streamers and flowers mid-preparation. A sense of *almost* celebration.  
- **NPC Anchors**:  
  - [[Mira Fenwick - Child]] — child, playing with friends.  
  - [[Captain Rowan Harth]] — barking orders at workers to keep the square clear.  
- **Loop Potential**:  
  - Festival is **never completed** before the loop ends.  
  - Each cycle looks slightly different (more decorations, fuller stalls, more candles lit).  
  - The unfinished festival becomes a **visual countdown** to the catastrophe.
