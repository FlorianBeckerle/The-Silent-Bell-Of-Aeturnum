## What if the players  want to Investigate
- **Low rolls / casual notice:** odd but explainable (bread always steaming, same story told again, weird smell).
    
- **Medium rolls / attentive players:** cracks in the loop (wrong dates, repeating gestures, shadows behaving strangely).
    
- **High rolls / sharp insight:** direct foreshadowing (their own reflection off, bells ringing from nowhere, NPC slipping like they remember past loops).
### **Town / Festival Area**

- A banner has the wrong date written on it, like it’s celebrating last year’s harvest instead of today’s.
    
- A musician’s song seems cheerful, but one bar is always played slightly off-beat — like they’ve played it too many times.
    
- You see a child chasing a ball… but the ball always rolls to the exact same crack in the cobblestones.
    
- Freshly baked bread on a stall is still steaming, but no one ever buys it. Every loop, it’s the same.
    
- An NPC laughs at a joke before it’s told, then quickly covers their mouth.

### **Clocktower / Streets**

- The clocktower hands tick, but when you look away and back, they’re in the exact same position.
    
- Pigeons scatter suddenly — but when you glance up, the sky hasn’t changed.
    
- The shadows of nearby buildings stretch unnaturally long, even though the sun is high.
    
- A faint ringing (like a bell) echoes even when the clocktower is silent.
    
- A door is always locked, but the dust on the handle suggests it was just used.

### **Tavern / Indoors**

- A candle flickers even though there’s no draft. If stared at, the flame bends toward the players.
    
- Someone’s mug is always half-empty no matter how often it’s filled.
    
- A patron tells a story you already overheard word-for-word, with the exact same hand gestures.
    
- The innkeeper always scratches their right ear before greeting you.
    
- The smell of smoke lingers faintly, though the fireplace is clean and unlit.

### **General “Sketchy” Details**

- An NPC you pass has a shadow that lags behind them by a second.
    
- A child drops a toy, but when you pick it up, it crumbles into ash.
    
- Writing on a wall changes between loops (or even mid-look).
    
- Dogs bark at something unseen, always at the same moment in the day.
    
- You catch a flash of your own reflection in a window, but it’s… smiling when you’re not.
