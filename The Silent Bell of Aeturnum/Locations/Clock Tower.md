## Floor 1 – The Barricade

**Theme:** Citizens turned husks & mercenaries corrupted by coin.

- **Enemies:**
    
    - 4× **Sellswords** (Tier 1 Minions).
        
    - 2× **Corrupted Townsfolk** (reflavored husk-type minions with weak melee attacks).
        
- **Twist:** The sellswords were hired to guard the tower doors — now they’re just thralls driven by greed and corruption.
    
- **Feature:** A pile of festival goods by the stairs. Searching reveals **corrupted crystal dust** hidden among food barrels.
    
- **Exit:** Wooden stairs spiraling upward, part burned by black smoke.

## Floor 2 – The Gallery of Shadows

**Theme:** Narrow balconies, broken stained-glass windows, purple light leaking in.

- **Enemies:**
    
    - 3× **Skeleton Archers** stationed on balconies.
        
    - 1× **Sellsword** leading them as a corrupted “captain.”
        
- **Hazard:** Falling debris & swinging pendulum-weights from the clock gears. PCs must make **Instinct checks** to avoid damage if shoved.
    
- **Optional Skill Challenge:** PCs can destroy supports to collapse part of the floor, cutting off reinforcements but making navigation harder.
    
- **Exit:** Winding staircase leading up, echoing with the faint toll of the bell.

## Floor 3 – The Bell Chamber

**Theme:** A massive chamber beneath the great bell. Crystal veins spread across walls, pulsing like veins of a heart. Shadows drip from the ceiling.

- **Enemies:**
    
    - 4× **Skeleton Archers** perched on beams.
        
    - 2× **Sellswords** blocking the stair to the roof.
        
- **Environmental Hazard:** Every round, the bell pulses. PCs must succeed on a **Spirit roll** or gain **Fear** from psychic resonance.
    
- **Discovery:** The corrupted runes are etched along the bell’s rim. With investigation, PCs learn they can:
    
    - Attempt to **cleanse them** (ritual option).
        
    - **Smash them** (combat option).

## Rooftop – The Final Toll

**Theme:** The night sky opens, festival smoke floods the square below. The bell shatters — and the **Demon of Despair** emerges.

- **Final Boss:** Demon of Avarice (Tier 3 Skulk).
    
- **Adds:** At start, 2 corrupted townsfolk spawn each round until bell is destroyed/ritual is performed.
    
- **Climactic Choice:**
    
    - Defeat the demon in combat.
        
    - Seal it via ritual (skill challenge with risks).
        
    - Sacrifice (a PC or NPC binds with the bell to keep it sealed).
